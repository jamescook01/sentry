.. _faq-2:

I accidentally merged issues together, can I unmerge?
-----------------------------------------------------

**A**: No. Merging is a permanent action. However, you can delete the merged
issue and the future events will be grouped together how they originally would
be.

.. _faq-3:

I want to search all events with a certain tag. How come when I select an issue, the event shows a different value for that tag?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**A**: If you are searching by tag within a certain project, you will get issues that contain at least one event with that given tag.
If you select a particular issue, you can search after selecting the "Related Events" tab to find the exact events with the tag you are
searching for.

**Example:**

Desired tag: release:97eaa54

  .. image:: /../design/images/faq3-1.png


Selecting an issue [the first one for example] shows you the most recent event for that issue. Selecting "Related Events" will give you all the events for that particular issue

Searching under "Related Events" gives you specific events with the desired tag

.. _faq-4:

Iâ€™m seeing [Filtered] data, what is causing that?
-------------------------------------------------

**A**: This is because you have Data Scrubbers enabled.

.. image:: /../design/images/faq4.png

Data Scrubbers can operate at both an **organization** level and a **project** level.
This is option can be found at ``https://sentry.io/organizations/{organization}/settings/`` and
at ``https://sentry.io/organizations/{organization_slug}/{project_slug}/settings/``.

If you have Data Scrubbers enabled on the organization level, they are applied to *every* project.

See `Sensitive Data <https://docs.sentry.io/learn/sensitive-data>`__ for more detailed information

.. _faq-5:

How come when I search for additional data information, I don't see any results?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**A**: Additional data such as User Context or Extra Context is not indexed. This information
must be included as a Tag.

However, for User Context, Sentry provides four field names that are already indexed, and therefore
searchable if the information is provided:

  .. describe:: id
  .. describe:: username
  .. describe:: email
  .. describe:: ip


See `Context <https://docs.sentry.io/learn/context/#context>`__ for more detailed information
