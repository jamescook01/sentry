Support
=======

We provide support for the Cloud and Enterprise Edition.

.. sentry:edition:: cloud, enterprise

    General Support
    ---------------

    There are a few avenues for getting support. You can always email us via
    support@getsentry.com, but we suggest reserving that for actual problems
    with the service.

    Outside of email, there's a few areas where you can get support pretty
    easily (and generally more quickly):

.. sentry:edition:: cloud, enterprise, community

    Community Support
    -----------------

    The community support is where you can go to get questions answered with
    either the sentry community edition or some community maintained projects.

    IRC
        `irc.freenode.net #sentry <irc://irc.freenode.net/sentry>`_
    Twitter
        `@getsentry <https://twitter.com/getsentry>`_
    Google Groups
        `Google Groups <https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/getsentry>`_

    If you're looking for support on a specific client, check the
    documentation specific to that client. Several clients are maintained by
    the Sentry team, whereas others are not. Nearly every client also has it's
    own bug tracker, which is generally where the code lives (i.e. on GitHub).
