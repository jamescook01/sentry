Support
=======

As a paying customer of Hosted Sentry or Sentry On-Premise you have access
to various forms of support; and if you are using the Open Source version
you can get in contact with the Sentry community for questions.

    System Status
    -------------

    The availability of the Sentry cloud hosted installation is independently
    monitored from outside the infrastructure.  To monitor the availability,
    get notifications and read status updates about outages you can visit the
    status page at `status.getsentry.com <http://status.getsentry.com/>`_.
    There you can also subscribe to email and SMS notifications.

    We also update the twitter feed `@getsentry
    <https://twitter.com/getsentry>`_ with status updates.

    General Support
    ---------------

    There are a few avenues for getting support. You can always email us via
    support@getsentry.com, but we suggest reserving that for actual problems
    with the service.

    Outside of email, there's a few areas where you can get support pretty
    easily (and generally more quickly):

Community Support
-----------------

The community support is where you can go to get questions answered with
either the sentry community edition or some community maintained projects.

IRC
    `irc.freenode.net #sentry <irc://irc.freenode.net/sentry>`_
Google Groups
    `Google Groups <https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/getsentry>`_

If you're looking for support on a specific client, check the
documentation specific to that client. Several clients are maintained by
the Sentry team, whereas others are not. Nearly every client also has its
own bug tracker, which is generally where the code lives (i.e. on GitHub).
