Support
=======

As a paying customer of Hosted Sentry or Sentry On-Premise you have access
to various forms of support; and if you are using the Open Source version
you can get in contact with the Sentry community for questions.


System Status
-------------

The availability of the Sentry cloud hosted installation is independently
monitored from outside the infrastructure.  To monitor the availability,
get notifications and read status updates about outdates you can visit the
status page at `status.getsentry.com <http://status.sentry.io/>`_.
There you can also subscribe to email and SMS notifications.

We also update the twitter feed `@getsentry
<https://twitter.com/getsentry>`_ with status updates.

Community Support
-----------------

We offer community support through at `forum.sentry.io <https://forum.sentry.io/>`_. This
is a great place to provide product feedback, get help and advice with various issues,
as well as to take part in the larger Sentry community.

If you're looking for support on a specific SDK, check the
documentation specific to that SDK. Several SDKs are maintained by
the Sentry team, whereas others are not. Nearly every SDK also has its
own bug tracker, which is generally where the code lives (i.e. on GitHub).

Paid Support
------------

If you are a paid customer of either our hosted offering or On-Premise, you
can contact support via the support@sentry.io address. We suggest reserving
that for actual problems with the service, and when possible referring to
our documentation and community support.
