Support
=======

As a paying customer of Hosted Sentry or Sentry Enterprise you have access
to various forms of support; and if you are using the Open Source version
you can get in contact with the Sentry community for questions.

General Support
---------------

There are a few avenues for getting support. You can always email us via
support@getsentry.com, but we suggest reserving that for actual problems
with the service.

Outside of email, there's a few areas where you can get support pretty
easily (and generally more quickly):

Community Support
-----------------

The community support is where you can go to get questions answered with
either the sentry community edition or some community maintained projects.

IRC
    `irc.freenode.net #sentry <irc://irc.freenode.net/sentry>`_
Twitter
    `@getsentry <https://twitter.com/getsentry>`_
Google Groups
    `Google Groups <https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/getsentry>`_

If you're looking for support on a specific client, check the
documentation specific to that client. Several clients are maintained by
the Sentry team, whereas others are not. Nearly every client also has it's
own bug tracker, which is generally where the code lives (i.e. on GitHub).
