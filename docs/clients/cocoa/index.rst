Cocoa
=====

This is the documentation for our work in progress, official clients for
Cocoa.  This feature is currently under development and requires being
enrolled as early adopter on our hosted solution.

For Cocoa there are two clients available: one for :doc:`objc/index`, another
one for :doc:`swift/index`.  In either case you will need to :doc:`Upload
Your Symbols <dsym>` for us to be able to process your stacktraces.
