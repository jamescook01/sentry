Client Libraries
================

To submit events to sentry from your platform of choice, you can use the
raven clients.  These libraries exist for a wide range of programming
languages and runtime environments and are available under Open Source
licenses.

The official clients are named "raven clients".

   javascript/index
   php/index

Some of these clients are not yet documented here, but separately.  We're
working hard on consolidating the documentation.  Until then you can find
documentation for those clients separately:

*   `raven-ruby <https://github.com/getsentry/raven-ruby>`_
*   `raven-objc <https://github.com/getsentry/raven-objc>`_
*   `raven-java <https://github.com/getsentry/raven-java>`_
*   `raven-csharp <https://github.com/getsentry/raven-csharp>`_
