Client Libraries
================

To submit events to sentry from your platform of choice, you can use the
raven clients.  These libraries exist for a wide range of programming
languages and runtime environments and are available under Open Source
licenses.

The official clients are named "raven clients".

.. toctree::
   :hidden:

   python/index
   javascript/index
   php/index
   ruby/index

.. class:: platformlink

*   .. class:: platformlink-python

    :doc:`python/index` — including Django, Flask etc.

*   .. class:: platformlink-js

    :doc:`javascript/index` — including Node, Browser environments etc.

*   .. class:: platformlink-php

    :doc:`php/index` — including PHP applications

*   .. class:: platformlink-ruby

    :doc:`ruby/index` — including Rails, Sinatra, Rack and other environments.

Some of these clients are not yet documented here, but separately.  We're
working hard on consolidating the documentation.  Until then you can find
documentation for those clients separately:

*   `raven-objc <https://github.com/getsentry/raven-objc>`_
*   `raven-java <https://github.com/getsentry/raven-java>`_
*   `raven-csharp <https://github.com/getsentry/raven-csharp>`_
