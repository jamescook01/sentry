Hosted Sentry Status
====================

The availability of the Sentry cloud hosted installation is independently
monitored from outside the infrastructure.  To monitor the availability,
get notifications and read status updates about outdates you can visit the
status page at `status.getsentry.com <http://status.getsentry.com/>`_.
There you can also subscribe to email and SMS notifications.

We also update the twitter feed `@getsentry
<https://twitter.com/getsentry>`_ with status updates.
