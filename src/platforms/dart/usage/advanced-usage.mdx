## Requirements

- For the usage of the Dart SDK, the minimal required Dart SDK version is `2.8.0` and Flutter SDK version is `1.17.0`

## Tips for catching errors

- Use a `try/catch` block
- Use a `catchError` block for `Futures`
- `Isolate` errors on the `current` Isolate which is the equivalent of a main/UI thread, e.g. using `Isolate.current.addErrorListener`, are captured automatically (Only for non-Web Apps).
- For your own `Isolates`, add an `ErrorListener` and call `Sentry.captureException`
