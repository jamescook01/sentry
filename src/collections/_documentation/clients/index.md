To report to Sentry you’ll need to use a language-specific SDK. The Sentry team builds and maintains these for most popular languages, but there’s also a large ecosystem supported by the community. If your favorite language isn’t listed below, we encourage you to start a discussion about supporting it on our [community forum](https://forum.sentry.io).
