Sentry-Rust is the official Rust SDK for Sentry. It maps the entire Sentry protocol for Rust and provides convenient helpers for sending common types of events to Sentry.

## Installation

Sentry-Rust is distributed as a normal crate from crates.io. You can add it to your project as a dependency in your _Cargo.toml_ file:

```
[dependencies]
sentry = "0.6.0"
```

Additionally you can configure a bunch of features to enable or disable functionality in the crate. By default the most common features are compiled into the crate. For a list of features that are available refer to the [API Documentation](https://docs.rs/sentry).

## Configuring the Client

The client is configured by calling `sentry::init` with a value that can be converted into a configuration object. These are the most common values:

-   _an empty tuple_: in that case the client is configured from the `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable.
-   _a string holding a DSN_: if you pass a string then a DSN is parsed and the client is initialized with that DSN.
-   _a tuple in the form (dsn, options)_: This is a form where the client is configured with a DSN plus an options object that allows you to configure additional features.

This is the most common case for client configuration:

```rust
extern  crate  sentry;

fn main()  {
  sentry::init("___PUBLIC_DSN___");
  // code using sentry goes here.
}
```

To configure releases automatically you can use the `sentry_crate_release!` macro in combination with the tuple config syntax:

```rust
#[macro_use]  extern  crate  sentry;

fn main()  {
  sentry::init(("___PUBLIC_DSN___",  sentry::ClientOptions  {
  release: sentry_crate_release!(),
  ..Default::default()
  }));
  // code using sentry goes here.
}
```

## Reporting Errors

Once Sentry is configured errors and other events can be emitted. Since Rust has different mechanisms by which errors can be issued different functionality is provided for them. By default support for the new [failure](https://docs.rs/failure) error system is provided.

For instance to report a `failure::Error` this code can be used:

```rust
use  sentry::integrations::failure::capture_error;

let  result  =  match  a_function_that_might_fail()  {
  Ok(val)  =>  val,
  Err(err)  =>  {
  capture_error(&err);
  return  Err(err);
  }
};
```

## Catching Panics

To automatically catch panics the panic integration can be used:

```rust
use  sentry::integrations::panic::register_panic_handler;

fn main()  {
  sentry::init(...);
  register_panic_handler();
}
```

## Flushing Errors on Shutdown

Since Sentry Rust uses a thread to offload event sending itâ€™s possible that pending events are not sent on shutdown. There are two ways to prevent this from happening. The first one is to retain the guard returned from `sentry::init` which will flush out in the _Drop_ implementation (it will wait up to 2 seconds for this):

```rust
fn main()  {
  let  _guard  =  sentry::init(...);
}
```
