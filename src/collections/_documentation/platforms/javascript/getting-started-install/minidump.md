Sentry can process Minidump crash reports, a memory dump used on Windows and by open-source libraries like [_Breakpad_]({%- link _documentation/platforms/minidump/breakpad.md -%}) or [_Crashpad_]({%- link _documentation/platforms/minidump/crashpad.md -%}). You can either choose to generate and upload minidumps yourself or use a higher-level SDK for platforms with built-in support for native crashes:

-   [_Cocoa_]({%- link _documentation/clients/cocoa/index.md -%})
-   [_Electron_]({%- link _documentation/platforms/javascript/electron/index.md -%})
-   [_Unreal Engine 4_]({%- link _documentation/platforms/unrealengine/index.md -%})
